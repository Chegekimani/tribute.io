    <h2>The life of Dangote</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Aliko Dangote was born in<strong> 1957</strong> to a business oriented household in Kano State, Nigeria.</li>
      <li>Unlike many other self-made billionaires, Aliko Dangote was born with a silver spoon. His grand father, Sanusi Dantata, was one of the wealthiest men in West Africa at the time. He made a bulk of his fortune from groundnuts, oats, and rice.</li>
      <li>Following the death of his father, Aliko Dangote’s grandfather took him in and became his defacto guardian. Living with his grand father exposed him to the different rudiments of entrepreneurship. He learnt a lot about marketing, procuring goods, establishing customer relationships, and more. This even prompted him to start selling boxes of sweets (candy bars) in primary school to his classmates as one of his first trials at entrepreneurship.</li>
      <li>After his graduation from Al-Azhar University in Egypt, in <strong>1977</strong>, Aliko Dangote at age 21, got a loan of 500,000 Naira ($2,500) from his grand father to start a trade in commodities, to be repaid within three years. At that time, 500,000 Naira could buy one hundred Mercedes Benz in Nigeria.</li>
      <li>As he took steps towards manufacturing in<strong> 1997</strong>, he began to produce sugar, flour, and pasta. He was later awarded a cement plant by the federal government, and further built a multi-million dollar cement manufacturing plant in <strong>2005</strong> with $319 million dollars of his own money, and a $479 million dollar loan from the World Bank International Finance Corporation.</li>
      <li>Aliko Dangote’s success story is not that of a man who started from a poor or comfortable home and eventually achieved great wealth. His story is that of a child every wealthy parent dreams of. The child who doesn’t need to inherit his/her family’s properties, but one who can turn a loan given to them into a multi-billion dollar empire.

While his story may not be the typical rags to riches type, his success story is definitely an inspiration to anyone that has some start-up capital and hopes to someday become one of the richest people in the world.</li>
      </ul>
